# REQUIREMENTS

# INTRODUCTION 
The project is to predict the electricity bill of next month by taking input of appliance or load used,and this application based mini project is the Electric Bill calculator project. The visual studio code tool is used for writing the code in this project. This project has multi file and multiplatform approach.

# RESEARCH

 This application is to predict electricity bill of upcoming months for the people who don’t have technical knowledge of calculating electricity bill. However, the defining features of an electricity bill calculator include:

- current rating of all loads
- total load speculation
- unit used per day
- units absorbed per month

In addition, high-end electricity bill calculators generally include:

- Calculation of bill in city
- Calculation of bill in village
- Calculation of bill based on units consumed


Defining System 

The unit testing algorithm is used for design and testing operations of electricity bill calculator. 

Strengths: Creative, Easy-to-use.

Weakness: Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increase.

Opportunities: We know that we mostly use traditional method for calculation. So technology involved market is always an eye catcher for the youth.

Threats: Slow growth in this innovative world is always a menace for the company in this fast growing world.
